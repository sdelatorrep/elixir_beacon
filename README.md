#Requirements
* Java 8 JDK
* Apache Maven 3
* PostgreSQL Server 9.0+, or any other SQL server (i. e. MySQL)
* JMeter

#Quick start
This quick start guide uses the default configuration and sets the application up using some sample data. It requires a Postgres server running in the local machine and listening to the default port 5432.

If you want to tune the configuration or load custom data, please, skip this section and keep reading.

* Create 2 databases and a new user (use *r783qjkldDsiu* as password)
```
createdb elixir_beacon_dev -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres
createdb elixir_beacon_testing -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres
createuser -P microaccounts_dev
psql elixir_beacon_dev -U postgres
```
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE elixir_beacon_dev TO microaccounts_dev;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE elixir_beacon_testing TO microaccounts_dev;
```
* Load the schema (download [elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql))
```
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d elixir_beacon_dev -U microaccounts_dev < elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d elixir_beacon_dev -U elixir_beacon_testing < elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql
```
* Load data (download [EGAD00000000028.SNPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/EGAD00000000028.SNPs))
```
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d elixir_beacon_dev -U microaccounts_dev
```
```sql
INSERT INTO beacon_dataset(id, description, access_type, reference_genome, size)
  VALUES ('EGAD00000000028', 'Sample variants', 'PUBLIC', 'grch37', 34114);
```
```
cat EGAD00000000028.SNPs | psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U microaccounts_dev -c "COPY beacon_data_table(dataset_id,chromosome,position,alternate) FROM STDIN USING DELIMITERS ';' CSV" elixir_beacon_dev
```
* Download the code
```
git clone https://github.com/elixirhub/human-data-beacon.git
cd human-data-beacon
cd elixir_beacon
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ..
cd elixir_core
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
* Prepare dependencies
```
cd elixir_core
mvn clean compile jar:jar
mvn install
```
* Compile and deploy the application
```
cd elixir_beacon
mvn clean compile package -Dspring.profiles.active="dev"
cd target
java -jar elixir-beacon-0.3.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```
* Go to 
  * [localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/info](http://localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/info)
  * [localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=11&position=1951960&alternateBases=G&assemblyId=GRCh37&datasetIds=EGAD00000000028](http://localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=11&position=1951960&alternateBases=G&assemblyId=GRCh37&datasetIds=EGAD00000000028)

#Configure databases
##Create databases
* Create two databases. Default names are:
    * **elixir_beacon_dev**: this is the main database that will be used by the application.
    * **elixir_beacon_testing**: this is a secondary database that will be used to run the tests.
```
createdb elixir_beacon_dev -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres
createdb elixir_beacon_testing -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres
```
NOTE: If you want to use a different name, user or your Postgres server is listening to a different port, please, replace the values in the prevoius command.

* Create a user that will be used by the application to connect to the databases just created:
```
createuser -P microaccounts_dev
```
This command will propt for the password of the new user.

* Log in each of the databases and grant privileges to a normal user (that is, not a super user), i. e. the user just created in the previous step:
```
psql elixir_beacon_dev -U postgres
```
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE elixir_beacon_dev TO microaccounts_dev;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE elixir_beacon_testing TO microaccounts_dev;
```

NOTE: You can skip this step and load the schema using a super user in the next step and after that, granting privileges to a normal user (this user will be used by the application to connect to the database).

* Download the schema script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql) and run it in **both** databases: 
```
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d elixir_beacon_dev -U microaccounts_dev < elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d elixir_beacon_dev -U elixir_beacon_testing < elixir_beacon_db_schema.sql
```
That script will create the schema and also load some essential data for data use conditions.

If you use a super user to create the schema then you will need to grant access to the "normal" user that will be used by the application (that user we created in the second step):
```
psql elixir_beacon_dev -U postgres
```
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO microaccounts_dev;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO microaccounts_dev;
```
Remember to run these lines in both databases.

##Load the data
* Download the script to parse VCF files [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/vcf_parser.sh) and give it executable rights:
```
chmod +x vcf_parser.sh
```
* Run this script executing:
```
./vcf_parser.sh dataset_id < file.vcf
```
This script will generate an output file called dataset_id.SNPs.
It will also output the number of variants extracted from the VCF. This value is the "size" in the next step.

* Load the dataset information into **beacon_dataset_table**.
```sql
INSERT INTO beacon_dataset(id, description, access_type, reference_genome, size)
    VALUES ('dataset_id', 'dataset_description', 'PUBLIC', 'grch37', 123456);
```
NOTE: Remember to replace the values in the previous command with the correct ones.

* Load the generated file into **beacon_data_table**:
```
cat dataset_id.SNPs | psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U microaccounts_dev -c "COPY beacon_data_table(dataset_id,chromosome,position,alternate) FROM STDIN USING DELIMITERS ';' CSV" elixir_beacon_dev
```
NOTE: This command should be executed only in the **elixir_beacon_dev** database. The testing database will be initialized with some data when the tests are run.

#Managing the code
##Download the project
Clone the projects **elixir_beacon** (current one) and **elixir_core** located at the [Elixir's repository](https://github.com/elixirhub/human-data-beacon).
```
git clone https://github.com/elixirhub/human-data-beacon.git
```
Then download each of the projects (submodules in git terminology):
```
cd human-data-beacon
cd elixir_beacon
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Do the same for the other project.

##Elixir Core
First of all, it is necessary to compile the code of the **elixir_core** project because it is a dependency of the main project, elixir_beacon.
```
cd elixir_core
mvn clean compile jar:jar
```
This will generate the JAR file **elixir-core-beacon_api_v0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar** inside the /target folder.

Then execute:
```
mvn install
```
Now this dependency will be found when compiling the main project, elixir_beacon.

##Elixir Beacon, the main project
###Project structure
The project has the following structure:
* /src/main/java
    * Java files (.java).
* /src/main/resources
    * configuration files: .properies, .yml
* /src/test/java
    * Java classes for testing.
* /src/test/resources
    * configuration files for testing: .properties, .yml
* /target/generated-sources/java
    * auto generated Java files.
* /target/classes
    * compiled files (.class).
* /target
    * among other things, contains the .jar file with the compiled classes, libraries, etc.

###Configuration files
The key files are **/src/main/resources/application-{profile}.properties** and **/src/test/resources/application-{profile}.properties** (see [Deploy JAR](https://github.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/blob/master/README.md#deploy-the-jar) for more information about profiles).

By default, the application is deployed at port **9075** and the context is **/elixirbeacon/v03/**. You can change this by modifying the following lines of the application-{profile}.properties file:
```INI
server.port=9075
server.servlet-path=/v03
server.context-path=/elixirbeacon
```
As explained at the beginning, the application uses two PostgreSQL databases named **elixir_beacon_dev** and **elixir_beacon_testing**.
```INI
datasource.elixirbeacon.url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/elixir_beacon_dev
datasource.elixirbeacon.username=microaccounts_dev
datasource.elixirbeacon.password=PUT HERE YOUR PASSWORD
datasource.elixirbeacon.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
```
1. Specify the type of the database (postgresql), the hostname (default, 127.0.0.1), port (default, 5432) and finally the database name.
    * I. e. if you use MySQL: jdbc:mysql
2. Username that will be used to connect to the database (default, microaccounts_dev).
3. Password of that username.
4. Driver class name 
    * if you use MySQL: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
```INI
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```
1. Hibernate dialect.
    * if you use MySQL: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
 
If you use a different DB than Postgres, you must add the corresponding library to the **/lib** folder inside the JAR (you don't need to recompile) or add the dependency to the pom.xml so maven can download the library (this will force you to compile, see next step).

##Compile and test the code
To compile the code run the following command within the project folder:
```
cd elixir_beacon
mvn clean compile package -Dspring.profiles.active="dev"
```
That will also execute the tests. To skip them add <code>-Dmaven.test.skip=true</code> to the command.

To execute only the tests run:
```
mvn test
```
NOTE: To execute the tests you should use a different database than the main one (i. e. elixir_beacon_testing, see [Create databases](https://github.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/blob/master/README.md#create-databases)).

If compilation and test execution are successful, a JAR file will be generated in the folder **/target** with the name **elixir-beacon-0.3.jar**

##Deploy the JAR
To deploy the JAR run run the following command within the **elixir_beacon/target** folder:
 ```
cd target
java -jar elixir-beacon-0.3.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
 ```
It will generate a log in the file **application.log** located in the same folder where the JAR is located (by default, elixir_beacon/target but you can move the JAR file wherever you want and deploy it there).

This argument <code>--spring.profiles.active=dev</code> specifies the profile to be used. By default, there are 2 profiles: **dev** and **test**. Each profile will use its own set of properties files. 

I. e. **dev** profile will use:
* application-dev.properties
* application-dev.yml

Using the default configuration, the application will be available at: [localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/](http://localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/)

##Run integration tests
We use JMeter to run this kind of tests. We have an artifact called **elixir-beacon-service-tests**. 

To get the code download the project elixir_beacon_tests (you should already have the folder created but empty, follow [these steps](https://github.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/blob/master/README.md#download-the-project) to download the content).

Once you have downloaded this project you can just run:
```
mvn -P local clean verify
 ```
This will download jmeter and run some basic tests.

The <code>-P local</code> refers to a maven profile. These profiles can be found in the file pom.xml. The **local** profile uses this configuration for running the tests:
* host: localhost 
* port: 9075 

For other configurations please add a profile in pom.xml file. You will see the results on the console.

#Using the application
The application publishes two endpoints:
* /beacon/info
* /beacon/query

They are defined in the **org.ega_archive.elixirbeacon.ElixirBeaconController** class.

##/beacon/info
Returns the information about this beacon: its Id, name and description, the API version it is compliant with, the URL where you can access this beacon, etc.

```
The 3 examples that appear in field sampleAlleleRequests can be customized by modifying **application-{profile}.yml** as explained in [Configure application](https://github.com/sdelatorrep/elixir_beacon/blob/master/README.md#configure-application).

##/beacon/query
To actually ask the beacon for questions like "do you have any genomes with an 'A' at position 100,735 on chromosome 3?" And the answer will be yes or no.

Parameters:
* assemblyId
    * I. e. GRCh37
* referenceName
    * Accepted values: 1-22, X, Y, MT
* position
* alternate (optional)
    * Regular expression: [ACTG]+
    * I. e. alternate=A, alternate=CG, etc.
* datasetIds (optional)
    * I. e. ?datasetIds=some-id&datasetIds=another-id

[localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=1&position=179832996&assemblyId=GRCh37](http://localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=1&position=179832996&assemblyId=GRCh37)
```json
{
  "beaconId" : "elixir-demo-beacon",
  "exists" : true,
  "error" : null,
  "alleleRequest" : {
    "alternateBases" : "A",
    "referenceBases" : null,
    "referenceName" : "1",
    "position" : 179832996,
    "assemblyId" : "GRCh37",
    "datasetIds" : null
  },
  "datasetAlleleResponses" : null
}
```
Or you can ask for the same information in an specific dataset:

[localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=1&position=179832996&assemblyId=GRCh37&datasetIds=EGAD00001000740](http://localhost:9075/elixirbeacon/v03/beacon/query?referenceName=1&position=179832996&assemblyId=GRCh37&datasetIds=EGAD00001000740)
```json
{
  "beaconId" : "elixir-demo-beacon",
  "exists" : true,
  "error" : null,
  "alleleRequest" : {
    "alternateBases" : "A",
    "referenceBases" : null,
    "referenceName" : "1",
    "position" : 179832996,
    "assemblyId" : "GRCh37",
    "datasetIds" : [ "EGAD00001000740" ]
  },
  "datasetAlleleResponses" : [ {
    "datasetId" : "EGAD00001000740",
    "exists" : true,
    "error" : null,
    "frequency" : null,
    "variantCount" : null,
    "callCount" : null,
    "sampleCount" : null,
    "note" : "OK",
    "externalUrl" : null,
    "info" : null
  } ]
}
```

#Extend/Change functionality
You have two options:

1. Editing the source code.
    * If you want to add new functionalities (i. e. new endpoints).
2. Changing the implementation class.
    * If you want to change the way something is done (i. e. you want to modify the query, to check some requirements in the parameters, etc.)
    * You can write your own implementation for the interface **org.ega_archive.elixirbeacon.ElixirBeaconService**
    * This application uses [Spring framework](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.0.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/). Specifically we use [Spring boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/).
    * The following steps will allow you to make a custom implementation:
        * Create a new maven project:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
            <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
          
            <groupId>org.ega_archive</groupId>
            <artifactId>elixir-beacon-custom</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <packaging>jar</packaging>
          
            <name>elixir-beacon-custom</name>
            <description>elixir-beacon-custom</description>
          
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.ega_archive</groupId>
                    <artifactId>elixir-beacon</artifactId>
                    <version>put version here, i.e: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </project>
        ```
        * After That create the package **org.ega_archive.custom.elixirbeacon.** (by default, our app will scan org.ega_archive.custom.elixirbeacon package to try to find candidates for our services) If you want to use a different package name, you must cusomize your application properties name and add the property:
        ```INI
        custom.package.scan=org.my.custom
        ```
        * Inside that folder create a services package and a write your custom implementation 
        ```java
        package org.ega_archive.elixirbeacon.service;
        
        import org.ega_archive.elixirbeacon.dto.Beacon;
        import org.ega_archive.elixirbeacon.dto.BeaconAlleleResponse;

        * Compile your code:
        ```
        mvn clean compile jar:jar
        ```
        This will generate a **elixir-beacon-custom-version.jar**.
        
        If you get an error of the depency not found, it it because you don't have a repo with the dependency artifact. In this case, you can go to the elixir-beacon aritfact and execute:
        ```
        mvn install
        ```
        This will install the artifact in your local repo. After that try to compile again your custom code.
        * Execute the program with your code: 
            * First create an empty folder an copy there the original elixir jar (elixir-beacon-0.3.jar)
            * Then create a /lib folder and put the elixir-beacon-custom-version.jar jar in that folder
            * After that you can run the program executing:
            ```
            java -Dloader.path=lib/ -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar elixir-beacon-0.3.jar
            ```
